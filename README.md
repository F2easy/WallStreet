## OverView

- Wallstreet is a business analysis app that would help investors make sound financial decisions. It would simulate a stock market app while also giving the user some information about the given company. Note this wasn't made by financial profesionals and apply suggestions at your own descretion. However it will provide up to date financial information for a multitude of fortune 500 companies and some general company info as well. This project was created using a Mern Stack as well as an API that provides the Business Information.
